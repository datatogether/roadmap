# Project Guidelines

Each project repository **requires**, at a minimum:

1. Readme -- `README.md`
1. License -- `LICENSE`
1. Contributing Guidelines -- `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`
1. Issue Template -- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`

## Readme

Each **readme** follows a [`README.md` template](./templates/README.md)

## License

[GPLv3](http://gplv3.fsf.org/)--or
[AGPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) ([_why Affero?_
](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html))--is our _preferred_
**license** for code, and [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
for creative works and documentation.

We also use a [License and Copyright block](#license--copyright-readme-block),
added to our READMEs, add a [LICENSE](/LICENSE) to the repo, and occasionally
include a [Code Header License block](#code-header-license-block).

## Contributing Guidelines

We use a [`CONTRIBUTING.md` template](./templates/CONTRIBUTING.md) that points
to our main **Contributing Guidelines** located in
[`datatogether/datatogether`](),
the template can be extended to cover project- or repo- specific requirements.
